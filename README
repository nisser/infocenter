Hi! Here's how to use this program:

Notes:
    Client timeout is set to 1 minute.
    Timeout time can be changed by editing the global TIMEOUT variable.

Flags:
    Enable debugging: --debug=true/false (false by default).
    Enable custom host url: --url=http://anyurl:1337/infocenter (http://localhost:8080/infocenter by default).

Usage:
    1. Open two terminals.
    2. In terminal #1 start the program by using "go run .". Add flags if needed (see: Flags).
    3. Open a browser window, Google Chrome is recommended.
    4. In the browser, open the link you specified with the flag. If not specified, use the default "http://localhost:8080/infocenter/test". Remember to add the topic at the end of the url when connecting.
    5. If everything is done correctly, you should see "Client initialized" in the browser.
    6. Try sending a POST request to the topic using terminal #2 (http POST http://localhost:8080/infocenter/test --raw "hello").
    7. Message will show up in all browsers connected to the topic.
    8. Do nothing for a minute (by default) and a timeout event will fire, disconnecting the client from the topic.
